Softgun - A Software ARM 
---------------------------

Softgun is intended to emulate complete embedded Systems.
Boards with Netsilicon NS9750, Freescale i.MX21, Atmel
AT91RM92000, AT91SAM9263, ATMega644, R8C/M16C/M32C/RX are 
supported.

Compilation
-------------
Softgun requires a little Endian Linux machine  with a 
GNU Compiler installed. (It is known to work on IA32, AMD64 
PowerPC and ARM)
Type:

make
make install

For using the network you must give user of the emulator access
to /dev/net/tun and allow the user to execute ifconfig using "sudo".
Unfortunately newer linux kernels require the additional programm
sg_tunctl to create the virtual network interfaces.
Here a configuration example line for your /etc/sudoers

jkarrer   ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/ifconfig
jkarrer   ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/brctl
jkarrer   ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/sg_tunctl


Usage
---------
Create a directory for softgun configuration files called ~/.softgun.
Select the configuration file for your board from the directory
"configs" and copy it to the directory ~/.softgun/
Edit the ~/.softgun/yourboard.sg. It is required to change at least the path
for storing the diskimages. You have to create an empty directory
for the diskimages.
Run the emulator:

softgun yourboard -l flash flash.img

FS-Forth UNC90 Real world example:
------------------------------------
Use the unc90 configuration:

# mkdir ~/.softgun
# cp softgun/configs/unc90.sg ~/.softgun/

Edit the diskimage Path in ~/.softgun/unc90.sg

# mkdir ~user/unc90images
# vi ~/.softgun 

imagedir: /home/user/unc90images

Now start softgun. On first startup you have to load at least a bootloader 
into the flash. Here we load all (boot,kernel,rootfs). So insert the LxNETES-3.2 
CD-Rom from FS-Forth which contains precompiled images.

# softgun  -l uboot  /cdrom/images/unc90dev/u-boot-unc90dev.bin \
           -l kernel /cdrom/images/unc90dev/uImage-unc90dev \
           -l rootfs /cdrom/images/unc90dev/rootfs-unc90dev.jffs2 \
	   unc90

Byteorder
---------------

"softgun" is the binary for little endian memory system and
works with CPU in little endian or big endian mode.

The ARM CPU emulation can run in both byteorders.
Changing the endianess of  the CPU means that the CPU selects different byte
lanes for 16Bit and 8Bit accesses. If the CPU runs in big endian this
does NOT mean that the memory system is big endian. 

Running Big endian linux
------------------------
The ARM core of the real NS9750 goes to bigendian mode when the gpio 44 pin
is low during boot. In the emulator this is done in the configuration
file:    

[ns9750]
gpio44:         0       # Big Endian

Normally you want to run a big endian linux on softgun with a little
endian memory system. You have to store a big endian image in a little
endian memory. This means
you have to swap byteorder before or during loading. This is not a bug o
softgun. You have to do the same thing if you use a JTAG-programmer
which uses the Boundary scan mode. To avoid work, softgun can
convert the files which are loaded from the commandline to the memory or to
the flash image (binary, Intel-Hex or Srecord). 
The following configuration lines should be used whenever the memory system
Byteorder of your emulated system differs from the 32 Bit CPU Byteorder:

[loader]
swap32: 1 


Select Board
------------
softgun can emulate different Boards. You can select the
board in the global section of the config file:

[global]
board: NS9750DEV 

If you want to have a list of available boards, select some
nonsense. softgun will then display an error message with
a list of available boards

Every Board has a builtin default configuration. So you need
not specify RAM size and Flash Types if you want to use
the default types/sizes.

Loading Motorola S-Records
---------------------------
The filename should have the ending .mot
Start Addresses (S7, S8 and S9 records) found in S-Record file 
are currently ignored. Example:

softgun programm.mot

Loading Intel Hex Records
---------------------------
The filename should have the ending .hex
Start Addresses found in Hex-Record file are currently ignored 
Segmented address records are not implemented
Example:

softgun programm.hex

Ethernet Emulation:
-----------------------

Ethernet emulation is only working when the emulator is
running on Linux.

By default the NS9750 builtin Ethernet Controller and
three STE10/100 Tulip Compatible PCI-Ethernet Controllers
are emulated.
The  Linux TAP Ethernet Tunnel /dev/net/tun is used.  
Make sure that this device file exists and the emulator user
has the right to use it. Make sure that the driver tun.ko coming with the 
linux kernel is loaded.  

For every emulated Ethernet Card there will be two IP addresses. One on Host side and
one in the emulated environment.
Host side IP-Addresses are configured in the configfile .emuconfig.  
For SUSE Linux 9.3 you have to disable the firewall for the emulator interfaces. 
On Emulator side the IP addresses have to be configured using the
OS running in the emulator. If the emulator runs linux this is done 
with ifconfig in the shell running in the emulator.

Example: 
Add the following section to the configfile:

[ns9750_eth]
host_ip: 192.168.81.3
host_ifname: emu0

After booting the emulator login as root and type:

root@emu # ifconfig eth0 192.168.81.10
root@emu # ping -c 1 192.168.81.3

Bridged networking
------------------
Softgun can attach to a already existing bridge in
your Linux Host. This is useful if you want to reach
the emulator not only from the host machine, or if you
want to connect many emulators to a cluster. 
Using a bridge only one IP address for the host is required
(or none if you only want to create a cluster of emulators and you 
do not want to reach the host from the emulator) 
and one IP address in the OS on emulator for every emulated Interface.
The following example shows how to configure a host
with IP address 192.168.2.3 and an emulator with 
Address 192.168.2.4 to appear on your LAN using eth0.

1. Step: Prepare your host machine
--------
- Install the linux bridge_utils.
- Create a bridge with 

#root@host # brctl addbr br0

- Configure Interfaces which should be part 
  of the bridge:

root@host # ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 up
root@host # brctl addif br0 eth0
root@host # ifconfig br0 192.168.2.3 up

2. Step: attach your emulator to the bridge
--------
Add to the emulator configuration file:

[ns9750_eth]
host_ifname: emu0
host_ip: 0.0.0.0
bridge: br0

3. Step
-------
Start the emulator and configure the interface in 
the emulator to be in the same subnet like the host. 
Under Linux this is done in the emulator shell:

root@emu:/ # ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.4


SJA1000 CAN Controller Emulation
--------------------------------
The SJA-1000 CAN controller emulator is accessible through
/dev/canX in the emulator. From the host system you can 
send and receive the CAN messages from/to a TCP-Server socket. 
The port numbers are given in the configuration file:

[lacc_can0]
port: 8530

[lacc_can1]
port: 8531

System Clock
------------
The timing source for the emulated System is the CPU cycle counter of the
emulated CPU (target).
During the ARM's MMU wait-for-interrupt instruction the system runs with
the full speed of the real CPU. During other instructions the emulator is
slower. The wait for Interrupt function catches up a maximum of 1/4 of a
second when system has fallen behind the speed of the real device.


Permanent Flash storage and EEPROM storage
-------------------------------------------
There is one storage directory for all images of your Flash chips and
EEProms in the global configuration section. You have to create this
directory manually

[global]   
imagedir: /home/user/softgun_images 

to the .emuconfig 
On first startup one file per flash/eeprom will be created. The file
has the same name like the chip instance.  

Images which are loaded to the flash from the commandline will overwrite 
the old contents of your flash partially. This way you can update your basic
 system while keeping the rest of the flash.

Flash statistics
----------------
Flash statistics is useful for estimating the livetime of your NOR flash device.
Flash statistics is written into your diskimage directory.

The file flash1.stat contains the erase counters and will be updated whenever a 
sector is erased which contains at least one bit which is 0. 
The file is an array of unsigned 32Bit Integers in host byte order. There is
one integer for each sector. 
You can read the statistics file with a hexdumper:

od -tx4 -Ax flash1.stat

Flash Types
-----------
Available types:
 AM29LV800BT     - size 1024k
 AM29LV320MB     - size 4096k
 M29W320DB       - size 4096k
 MX29LV800CB     - size 1024k
 MX29LV800CT     - size 1024k
 AM29LV320ML     - size 4096k
 AM29LV640ML     - size 8192k
 MBM29LV650UE    - size 8192k
 AM29LV128ML     - size 16384k
 AM29LV256ML     - size 32768k
 S29GL256MR2    - size 32768k

 AM29BDS128H     - size 16384k
 S29GL128NR2    - size 16384k
 S29GL256NR2    - size 32768k
 S29GL512NR2    - size 32768k

 S29AL016DT      - size 2048k
 S29AL016DB      - size 2048k

The Chips are always used in 16 Bit mode, a bank
can have one (1x16) or two chips (2x16).
When more than one chip per bank is used the 
Flash image and the Flash statistics are interleaved

Configuration Example:

[flash1]
type: AM29LV640ML 
chips: 1

Serial Interfaces
-----------------
The default configuration file connects serial-A to stdin:

[ns9750] 
serialA: /dev/stdin

Do not connect more than one serial emulation to the same
device.

Debugging with gdb
-------------------
softgun listens on gdb remote protocol when enabled in config file.
GDB interface implements only the minimal required functions. 
You need gdb-6.8 build for arm:

configure --target arm-elf
make

Configuration file example:

[gdebug]
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 4711

First start the emulator, then connect with gdb:

# gdb ~/linux.arm/vmlinux

Security
----------
When you allow the User to modify your network using ifconfig he can mess up your
network configuration. Tcp connection to the gdb interface and the debugshell 
and connection to the CAN-Bus emulator socket are not encrypted and not 
protected with a password. Best configure them to allow connections only from
localhost (host: 127.0.0.1)  and disable them if you don't need them.
